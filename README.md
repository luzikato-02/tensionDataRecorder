# Tension Data Recorder

This web-based application consists of twisting and weaving tension data recording pages. The recorded data will be sent to the server and recorded in the database.
The server and all static elements are hosted in **Vercel**. But the database is hosted in **PlanetScale**. Since this is just a small application, we don't need any additional professional plan in both framework.
